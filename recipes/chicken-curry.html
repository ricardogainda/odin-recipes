    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipeingredients">
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup curry powder, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="recipesteps">
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute until soft and golden brown. 
                Slowly stir in curry powder. Once ingredients are blended together, add chicken breasts. 
                Cover skillet and simmer over medium low heat for about 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked 
                through and no longer pink inside.</li>
            <li>Remove cover from skillet and cook for an additional 15 minutes, until sauce reduces. 
                (Note: Make sure that you stir and that dish does not burn, as curry powder burns very easily!)</li>
